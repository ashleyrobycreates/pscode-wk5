// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

   IF (num1 % 2) === 0
	print num1
    ELSE (num1 !% 2) === 0
        print num1

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

	FOR num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 === sum
	    THEN sum/5 === average
		print average

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
	THEN 15/5 === 3
		print 3
